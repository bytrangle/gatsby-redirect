# Demo for redirecting in Gatsby
Please note that the **main** branch contains the starter code only, so that you can start from something that looks a little bit snazzier than Hello World. If you deploy from this branch, the live site won't have redirect functionality.

To check out the codes for redirection in Gatsby, checkout the branch **redirect**.

## How to use this repo
